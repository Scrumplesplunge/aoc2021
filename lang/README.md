# Advent of Code 2021

This repository will contain my solutions to Advent of Code 2021. Last year,
I solved them all in [plain C with no libraries, not even libc][1]. This year,
I'm going to try to implement my own C-like language and solve them all in that.
The `/lang` subdirectory contains the source code for a compiler, written in
C++, and the Advent of Code puzzles will be solved in that language.
